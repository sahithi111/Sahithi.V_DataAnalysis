Understanding GenZ Career Aspirations through data analysis of 3900+ observations:

Below are the phases I went through to perform data analysis

ASK:
Understanding the problem statement and problem context and the impact in detail is very much required in data analysis
I used 5WH framework to understand the problem statement clearly
PREPARE:
Understood the right kind of metrics that are needed to solve the problem better
Collected the data of GenZ employees and their career aspirations through a google form survey containing over 25 questions
I took into account the gender variations, infuencing factors, interest in higher education etc
PROCESS:
Then I cleaned the data through: deduplication, removing blanks, proper formatting, filtering columns, deletinf unnecessary information
I replaced the values that are too close or those that have blanks
ANALYZE:
Got to understand what the whole data tells me through slicers, filters, sql queries, pivot tables etc
I analysed the data with over 20+ pivot tables, 20+ SQL queries
SHARE:
Visualised the data to make the client understand about the whole story through appropriate charts.

Below are the conclusions I made from the analysis I performed from end to end:
OBSERVATIONS:
From the observations from the collected data, It is understood that GenZ employees like to:				
Work in progressive environment and wanted to create win-win situation both for company and themselves				
Willing to work for not more than 8hours				
Want to work with companies with clear goal				
Want work with manager who is more progressive and not someone who is disrespectful				
Want to work with company who's mission aligns with their actions				
GenZ career aspirations are greatly influenced by their parents in general				
Most GenZ employees expect salary of <50k after 3y and <151k after 5y in general 				
GenZ employees' decision to work with companies for long depends on various factors				
GenZ employees usually like to work at midsized companies				

However these insights are based on 3900+ records, more data is required to calculate deeper analysis to trigger strategic business decisions
